I will start to write some tutorials here to help readers understand why we need simulation based inference. Those materials will introduce basic concepts of simulation-based inference such as acceptance-rejection methods, random number generation for non-usual distributions, slice sampler, Metropolis_Hastings methods etc. Those methods are just to get you familiar on why and how we need these techniques. R or Python codes will be provided and can also be found in my GitHub repositories.
